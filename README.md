# Svelte Template Tool

```bash
npm init @mikhad/svelte
```

This is a work in progress and is not currently working. At the moment it just includes my previous svelte template, which I intend to drastically improve and automate.

	<summary>Desired functionality</summary>

- CLI That asks you:
  - Do you want a svelte or sveltekit application?
  - Do you want to use TypeScript?
  - Do you want to use SCSS?
  - Do you want a skeleton or starter app?
  - Do you want a github action to deploy to github pages for you?

- Dependabot on the github repo to keep the dependencies up to date
- Action to deploy to NPM
- The stuff that the regular sveltekit init asks you (Prettier, EsLint etc.)
